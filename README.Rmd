This package extracts Chemotherapy Regimens from the OMOP CDM Drug Exposures Table based on an algorithm developed by the OHDSI Oncology Workgroup.

## Installation

The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("meerapatelmd/oncoregimenfinder")
```  

## Example Run  

OncoRegimenFinder requires:  

* A connection to an OMOP CDM Instance (`conn`)  
* A designated schema where the results can be written to (`writeDatabaseSchema`) 

```{r params}
cdmDatabaseSchema <- "omop_cdm_2"
writeDatabaseSchema <- "oncoregimenfinder"
```

Execution performed by a single function call to `runORF()`

```{r run,eval=FALSE}
runORF(conn = conn,
       cdmDatabaseSchema = cdmDatabaseSchema,
       writeDatabaseSchema = writeDatabaseSchema)
```
